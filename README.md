## Installation
MVU uses NodeJs and Sqlite for its data storage and persistence. You need to install both on your device to fully see MVU in action. Please check installation guides for [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [Sqlite](https://www.servermania.com/kb/articles/install-sqlite/).

Once you have successfully installed both, clone the repository:

`git clone https://www.github.com/prodbyola/mini-video-uploader`

Then move into project folder

`cd mini-video-uploader`

Then launch server

`npm run serve`
